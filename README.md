## Assignment 1

I created a drawing **tool** that **analyzes** the concept of drawing. More specifically, how vector based graphics are drawn. Vector graphics are computed from point to point, which is demonstrated by the circles in the program. Lines are then drawn between each of the circles. Each circle and color is a different color to highlight their differences _(and also because they look cool  ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯  )_. It also shows how even circles and other fancy shapes can be abstracted to just many really small straight lines.

Hold the mouse down and drag to draw. Up arrow key to wipe and change to black. Down to wipe and change to white
